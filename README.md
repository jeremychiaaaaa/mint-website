This is a simple project I did when I first started learning solidity. This project is a simple mint-website mockup where I also used hardhat to test and deploy a smart contract I written. <br/>

This smart contract employs a dutch auction style where as for the whitelist mint, I made use of the merkle tree approach to validiate white list user address. The use of merkle tree is to reduce gas as the amount of memory transmitted on the network is minimised when using a merkle tree approach.
